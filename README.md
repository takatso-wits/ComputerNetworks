# ComputerNetworks
This is coolest Computer Networks Project.
We got to develop sockets.
## How does it work?
There are 2 Java server files that you need to execute. Take note of the port numbers (They are not the same);

## While your Servers are getting ready
Start your Android Studio project

## The Actual Application
This is a distributed application. You will input and interval and then the server will give you the 
total number of prime numbers in each interval and the time it took to calculate them.

# Fun isn't it?
